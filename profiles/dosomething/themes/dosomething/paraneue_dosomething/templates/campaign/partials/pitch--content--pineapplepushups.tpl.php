        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Guys often think sexist comments aren't cool but don't speak up against them because they feel they won't be supported when they do.</p>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>It's important for guys to shut down sexist comments, and they're more likely to do that when (a) they're supported by other guys; and (b) they have a clear and easy tactic to use.</p>
        <p>Have at least two teammates agree to do 10 push-ups when they say something sexist. You'll call each other out with the keyword "pineapple."</p>
