  "readme": "#unveil.js\n###A very lightweight plugin to lazy load images for jQuery or Zepto.js\n\n\n\nMost of us are familiar with the [Lazy Load](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload) plugin by [Mika Tuupola](http://www.appelsiini.net/).\nThis plugin is very useful and it boosts performance delaying loading of images in long web pages because images outside of viewport (visible part of web page) won't be loaded until the user scrolls to them.\nLazy Load has some cool options such as custom effects, container, events or data attribute. If you're not gonna use any of them you can reduce the file size by leaving just the essential code to show the images.\nThat's what I did and this is my lightweight version of Lazy Load with support for serving high-resolution images to devices with retina displays - less than 1k.\n\nVisit unveil's [project page](http://luis-almeida.github.com/unveil/) to read the documentation and see the demo.\n\n\n###Browser support\nCompatible with All Browsers and IE7+.\n\n\n###License\nUnveil is licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n",
