  "readme": "# Neue [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/wercker/ci/550b2c5b67ccfc73272e2f42.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DoSomething/neue) [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dosomething-neue.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dosomething-neue)\nThis is [Neue](http://neue.dosomething.org), our interface framework and pattern library. It defines a set of base styles and common patterns shared throughout our website. It's a strong foundation for building beautiful interfaces.\n\nNeue was built for our internal needs at DoSomething.org, but it could also work for your organization. Feel free to fork this repository and use it as a starting point for your own website and style guide, or read more about [why we open-source our code](https://blog.dosomething.org/we-open-sourced-our-code-heres-why-you-should-too/).\n\n### Usage\nYou can get your own copy of Neue by [downloading a release](https://github.com/DoSomething/neue/releases) or by using [NPM](http://npmjs.com):\n\n```\nnpm install dosomething-neue\n```\n\nInclude the bundled `dist/neue.css` and `dist/neue.js` in your page. Be sure to include jQuery 1.7+ and the bundled Modernizr build `dist/modernizr.js`. That's it! Check out the online [pattern library](http://neue.dosomething.org/) and start building.\n\nNeue supports Chrome 39+, Firefox 34+, Safari 7+, Android 4+, iOS 7+, and Internet Explorer 8+ (with polyfills). For IE 8 support, you'll need to include [HTML5Shiv](https://www.github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) and [Respond.js](https://www.github.com/scottjehl/Respond).\n\n### Local Development \nYou can also run the pattern library on your local machine! Here's the steps:\n\n  1. Fork & clone this repository.\n  2. Run `npm install` to configure dependencies.\n  3. Run `grunt` to build assets, watch for changes, and run styleguide server.\n  4. Check it out at `localhost:3000` in your browser!\n\n### License\n&copy;2015 DoSomething.org.
