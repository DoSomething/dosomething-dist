  "readme": "# jQuery.iecors\n\nThis is a new \"transport\" (or driver) for jQuery that allows the browser-like software known as IE 8 and 9 to make cross-domain AJAX requests using Microsoft's XDomainRequest object. No need for JSONP!\n\n# Installation\n\nCopy jquery.iecors.js into your javascripts directory. Include it in your web page.\n\n# Usage\n\n```javascript\n$.ajax({ ... });\n```\n\nYes, it's that simple! IE will try to use standard XHR, but will fail because it can't make cross-domain requests. Then, it will try this snazzy new driver and succeed.\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Derek Kastner\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
